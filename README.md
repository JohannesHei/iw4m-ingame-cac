iw4m-ingame-cac
===============

Mod for the IW4M project to enable the CAC menu while being ingame.

The launcher's purpose is to disable a check for the function 'SetPlayerData' which is required to save changes in the CAC menu.
It supports the following parameters:

*Launch 'LaunchIW4M.exe' in the current directory
  IW4MCACPatcher.exe

*Launch 'LaunchIW4M.exe' in a defined directory
  IW4MCACPatcher.exe "C:\pathTo\LaunchIW4M.exe"

*Launch 'iw4m.exe' directly
  IW4MCACPatcher.exe "C:\pathTo\iw4m.exe" "0"

The menu files are required to display a button for opening the CAC menu at the end of the game when displaying the summary.
They need to be put in the m2demo/ui_mp folder.

IW4M is a modification project of the game 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'
